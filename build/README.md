#Build
This folder isnt important until we are ready to deploy to our server (wherever we end up hosting it on)
The way this will work is when you are developing locally, you will run it from your machine, but before you push it to all your users
you want to make sure its efficient and minified. Minification is where a program will take your code 
and physically make the variable names and everything else smaller. It allows your js file sent to the browser much
smaller and faster to load. It will also take all the separate js files and combine them into one.
