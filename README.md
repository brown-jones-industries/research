# Big ideas
> First I think its a good idea to make a web service (api) that will do all of the functionality that we will need.
> 
> Then I think its a good idea to make a website first that can do what we want
> THEN we can go and make the Android and IOS apps.
> Im going to make the website in React (I dont know if you've heard of it or not),
> however there is a thing called React Native that allows you to create native IOS and Android apps with 
> the same or similar code base. So I think thats our best route

#Website

##Front end
- React
> Danny, hopefully you know react. Once I get everything set up I should be able to explain everything to you. Its pretty intuitive


- Typscript
> So I dont know if you've heard of typescript or not, but it is a superset language of javascript.
> Meaning any javascript you write is valid typescript, but not all typescript you write is valid javascript.
> Typescript is used to add a bunch of useful features to javascript, and it makes your life as a developer much easier.
> Its made by microsoft. You can look it up if youre confused

##Back end
> So here is where im not exactly sure what to do.
> My first bet is nodejs .... cause thats what im comfortable with.
> I think its the best idea but I want your input
> 
> As for the database, I think most of what we are doing would work best in an sql database. 
> Most of it is just going to be user data since the data that really makes this app work is available from ubers and lyfts api
> We dont need to actually store it.
> So my personal preference for sql databases is postgres, but I also would like your opinion on this as well.

#Other ideas
- Typescript on the front end code and backend code?
    - would keep things simple
- spaces not tabs - dont be an idiot
- code linters (Ill set it up) so we both have common styling and your editor will yell at you if you dont follow the rules
- Im probably going to use VSCode for this. Atom works too. Or IntelliJ. (IntelliJ always seems a little sluggish)
- Documentation
    - do we really need to worry about it with two people?
    - at minimum just comment your code well
